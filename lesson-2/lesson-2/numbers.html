        /* STEP 1: Number types (integer, float, and double)
        declare and initialize an integer and a float, then in the console, reveal the number type with typeof(varName) */
        let output = document.querySelector('p');
        
        // Note - there are also different number systems: binary, octal, and hexadecimal
        let myInt = 10;
        let myFloat = 5.6789;
        let typeTest = typeof(myFloat);

        /* STEP 2: Arithmetic operators
        + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (remainder or modulo), ** (exponent) */

        output.textContent = step2a;


        // Try declaring and initializing a couple of variables as numbers
        let num1 = 90;
        let num2 = 50;
        let step2b = (90+ 50)*5;
        output.textContent = step2b;


        /* ORâ€¦ num1 * num2 / 8 + 2 - 0.5; */

        /* Keep in mind operator precedence, just like you were taught in math class (/, *, +, -)
        num1 + num2 * 5 - 25 ... is not 575 ... it is 215 */
        
        /* If you want to avoid this precedence, use parenthesis
        (num1 + num2) * 5 - 25 */

        /* STEP 3: Increment and decrement operators
        ++ and -- are mostly found inside loops to move a counter variable to the next value when needed, either up or down. */
            let step3a = 3;
            let preincrement = ++step3a;//increment first and then assign

            console.log(postincrement);

        // Note 1 - you cannot increment/decrement a number directly
        // Note 2 - typing num++ or num-- in the console will output the number before incrementing or decrmenting - try ++num or --num, instead
